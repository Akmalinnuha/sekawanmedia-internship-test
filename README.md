This is a simple React Native application built using **Expo**. It consists of three main pages:
- **List Page**: Displays a list of data fetched from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
- **Detail Page**: Shows the detailed information of a selected item from the list.
- **Profile Page**: Displays a profile page containing a round profile image, name, a brief description, and contact information such as email, phone number, LinkedIn, GitHub, and portfolio.
